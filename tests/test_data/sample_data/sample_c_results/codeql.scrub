    Comparison is always true because i >= 0.
    When a comparison operation, such as x < y, always returns the same result, it means that the comparison is redundant and may mask a bug because a different check was intended.

    Comparison is always true because i >= 0.
    When a comparison operation, such as x < y, always returns the same result, it means that the comparison is redundant and may mask a bug because a different check was intended.
