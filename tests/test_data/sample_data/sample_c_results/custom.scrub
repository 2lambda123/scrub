custom001 <Low> :src/main.cpp:3: Misplaced include
    #include directives in a file shall only be preceded by other preprocessor directives or comments.
    '#include std_testcase_io.h' is preceded by code -- it should be moved above line 61 in std_testcase.h.

custom002 <Low> :src/main_linux.cpp:11: Function too long
    Function length should be limited to what can be printed on a single sheet of paper (60 lines). Number of parameters is limited to 6 or fewer.
    main has too many lines (88, while 60 are allowed).

custom003 <Low> :src/testcases.h:4: Use of basic integral type
    Typedefs that indicate size and signedness should be used in place of the basic types.
    intTwo uses the basic integral type int rather than a typedef with size and signedness.

custom004 <Low> :src/testcases.h:5: Use of basic integral type
    Typedefs that indicate size and signedness should be used in place of the basic types.
    intTwo uses the basic integral type int rather than a typedef with size and signedness.

custom005 <Low> :src/testcases.h:8: Use of basic integral type
    Typedefs that indicate size and signedness should be used in place of the basic types.
    intOne uses the basic integral type int rather than a typedef with size and signedness.
