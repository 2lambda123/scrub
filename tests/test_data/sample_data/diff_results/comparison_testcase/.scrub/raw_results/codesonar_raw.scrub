codesonar082 <Low> :/opt/project/comparison_testcase/testcasesupport/io.c:124: Negative Character Value
    isxdigit() is invoked here with an argument of signed type char, but only has defined behavior for int arguments that are either representable as unsigned char or equal to the value of macro EOF(-1).  - Casting the argument to unsigned char will avoid the undefined behavior.  In a number of libc implementations, isxdigit() is implemented using lookup tables (arrays): passing in a negative value can result in a read underrun.

    Pointer bytes is dereferenced in the body of decodeHexChars(), but may be NULL or otherwise invalid.  - When the highlighted code is executed, the pointers's validity is not checked:      - inside decodeHexChars() (before it is used), or      - at any point leading up to the call to decodeHexChars().  - For pointers, a check for validity must at least establish that the value is greater than zero.  - Power of Ten Rule 7 and JPL Rule 15 require that the validity of function parameters be checked before they are used.
