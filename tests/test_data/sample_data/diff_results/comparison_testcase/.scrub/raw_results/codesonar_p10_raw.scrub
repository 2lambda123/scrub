    The definition of true is not fully parenthesized.  - Unparenthesized macro definitions are legal, but can lead to unexpected behavior when the macro is used.  In particular, operator precedence may cause problems.  - Power of Ten Rule 8 and JPL Rule 20 require that macro definitions be "complete syntactic units".

codesonar104 <Low> :/opt/project/comparison_testcase/src/main_linux.cpp:1: Warnings Not Treated As Errors
    File main_linux.cpp was compiled without the -Werror option, so compiler warnings were not treated as errors. The compilation command was:
/usr/bin/gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -I ../testcasesupport 
See the parse details log for further information about this compilation.
